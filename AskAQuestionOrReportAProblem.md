# Ask a Question, Report a Problem, or Request a Feature #

## Problems with purchasing, downloading, or installing ##

If you are having problems with purchasing, downloading, or installing the app, please see [Google's support page](http://support.google.com/googleplay/bin/request.py?contact_type=market_phone_tablet_web).  I can only help with troubleshooting the app itself.

## Questions, Problems, and Requests ##

_**Note**_: I'm sometimes very slow to respond to bug reports (usually when I can't reproduce the issue). I do read and think about all reports right away, and anything serious usually gets fixed very quickly.

If you have an issue that isn't addressed in the [FAQ](http://code.google.com/p/battery-indicator/wiki/FAQ?tm=6), please:

  1. Search through the existing user-reported issues.
  1. If you find your issue and it solves your problem, you're done.
  1. If you find your issue and have something to add, please add a comment to it.
  1. If your issue is not already described, then create a new issue.  Note that if you have a problem report rather than just a question, you should switch from "Ask a Question" (the default) to "Report a Problem".

Search [existing questions](http://code.google.com/p/battery-indicator/issues/list?can=1&q=type=Question).

Search [existing problems](http://code.google.com/p/battery-indicator/issues/list?can=1&q=type=Defect).

Or, you can "Request a Feature".  Most requests are pretty good ideas
that nevertheless probably won't make it in, but every once in a
while, a user-suggested features does get added.  In any case, if you
want to suggest a feature, do it here.

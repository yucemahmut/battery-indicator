## PROJECT HAS MOVED ##

**17 March 2015**: Google has [announced](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html) that Google Code is shutting down!  All code and support has therefore moved to [GitHub](https://github.com/darshan-/Battery-Indicator-Support/blob/master/SourceCode.md).

The project will be left here on Google Code for as long as possible, but no further activity will take place here: all development and support will take place on GitHub.

## Summary ##

**BatteryBot** (formerly **Battery Indicator**) is a simple but useful app for Android.  Its original purpose was to provide an icon in the upper left notification area that shows the exact percentage of the battery charge.  It now does much more.

An early, low resolution version looked like this:

And like this when pulled down:
